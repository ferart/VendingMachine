# VendingMachine
VendingMachine

The project use the Model view presenter design pattern, it binds views with Butterknife framework, also it does dependency injection (Dagger 2 framework).
it has a splashScreen (a cinemagraph using a custom view), Activities, Dialog Fragments, Cards views.

i think it's an easy example with a good architecture and the use of popular frameworks.

Bullet points:

    Good architecture.
    Design Patterns applied.
    Use of popular frameworks.
    Custom views.
    maintainable project
